- **Update Index:** Updates the product's quantity based on changes in the share index.
- **Write to Output File:** Writes the final stock report to an output file.

## Technologies Used

- **C++:** The core programming language used to implement the stock management logic.
- **File I/O:** Utilizes file input and output operations to read from and write to files.
